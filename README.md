# Low level letters recognizer

Create low level (without any AI library) letters recognizer in Python. To do this I use only numpy and math library. I write every calculation for better understand Depp Neural Networks. My DNN is simply Neural Network with input, output and three hidden layers. I used very popular MINST handwritten letters data set. The result on validation set is 90% accuracy.
